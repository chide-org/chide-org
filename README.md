# Hi there! 👋

I'm a passionate undergraduate student at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), majoring in Bioinformatics at the College of Life Science and Technology.

## 🔍 About Me

- 🎓 **Education:** Studying Bioinformatics at HUST.
- 💻 **Programming Languages:** Proficient in Python and R, and actively engaged in crafting interesting projects.
- 📄 **Publications:** [Empowering Healthcare with Phage Display Technology](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsbiomaterials.5c00218)

## 🚀 What I Do

Knock on the code, read the paper, explore how AI is changing life sciences, and record those moments of inspiration by the way~

## 🌱 Currently Exploring

I am currently delving deeper into the intersection of artificial intelligence and bioinformatics, with a specialized focus on de novo design of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) using machine learning. My goal is to develop AI models that predict and optimize AMP sequences with high therapeutic potential. Alongside this, I’m exploring data correlation analysis techniques to uncover hidden patterns in biological datasets, enhancing my ability to derive actionable insights from complex systems.

To broaden my technical toolkit, I’m strengthening my foundations in computer science, particularly in Python for AI/ML and JavaScript for web development (using frameworks like Vue.js). This dual expertise allows me to build interactive platforms that visualize AI-generated AMP designs and their predicted biological properties.
